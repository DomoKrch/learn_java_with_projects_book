# Practical things from Learn Java with Projects book (by  Dr. Se√°n Kennedy & Maaike van Putten)

To brush up on my Java skills. Also, maybe someone would need a glimpse at book's exercises when buying it

I know, i know, this repo contains some newbie level stuff too, but...

***Repetition is the mother of learning, the father of action, which makes it the architect of accomplishment.***

Chapter 1 - very basic stuff

Chapter 2 - basic things, but with neat notes about primitive ranges

Chapter 3 - enjoyed the readings about compiler gotchas with types and casting
